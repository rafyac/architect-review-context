| Storage audit incomplete/inaccurate | Low | Medium | Script validation + manual review |
| Inference logging adds latency | Low | High | Performance test before prod |

### Sprint 2 Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Multi-region failover untested | Medium | Critical | Monthly failover drills scheduled |
| Post-deploy script breaks existing deployments | Medium | High | Test in dev/test env first |
| IaC validation too strict (blocks valid changes) | Low | Medium | Refinement based on feedback |

### Sprint 3 Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Storage consolidation data loss | Low | Critical | Backup all data before deletion |
| Content moderation false positives | Medium | Medium | Tuning & review process |
| Health probe misconfiguration causes cascading restarts | Low | High | Careful timing/threshold tuning |

- [ ] Review Cost Management dashboard (unexpected cost spikes)

### Quarterly Reviews
- [ ] Storage account usage analysis (consolidation working?)
- [ ] RBAC role assignment audit (least privilege maintained?)
