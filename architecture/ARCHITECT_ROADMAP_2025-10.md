# Architecture Improvement Roadmap (Q4 2025)

## Overview

This roadmap operationalizes Epic #16 (Architecture Improvement) and its 15 recommendation issues (#1-#15). Sequencing emphasizes security posture, drift prevention, and consolidation before optimization and sustainability.

## Sprint Allocation Summary

| Sprint | Focus Theme | Issues Target | Exit Criteria |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Week 1 (Sprint 1) | Security & Critical Governance | #1 #2 #4 #5 | Vault consolidated plan approved; RBAC change merged; Logic App inventory completed & consolidation PR open; AI logging design committed |
| Weeks 2-3 (Sprint 2) | Drift, Consolidation, Resilience | #3 #6 #7 #8 #9 #11 | Drift pipeline producing nightly report; plan consolidation decision & decommission list; rotation automation scheduled; container autoscale config applied; workspace consolidation plan documented; bias checklist draft reviewed |
| Weeks 4+ (Sprint 3) | Operational Guardrails & Optimization | #10 #12 #13 #14 #15 | Cache hit ratio baseline captured; purge protection + access audit enabled; policy guardrails enforced (non-compliant blocked); runtime consolidation decision recorded; off-peak scaling job operational |

## Dependency Mapping

| Issue | Depends On | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| #2 (RBAC) | #1 | Need target vault before assignments |
| #7 (Rotation) | #1 | Rotation policy centralized on primary vault |
| #3 (Drift pipeline) | None | Foundational visibility |
| #6 (Plan consolidation) | #3 | Drift report aids scope definition |
| #9 (Workspace consolidation) | #3 | Inventory confirmation before merge |
| #10 (Caching) | #14 | Runtime consolidation influences cache layer placement |
| #11 (Bias checklist) | #5 | Logging must capture model inputs/outputs first |
| #13 (Policy guardrails) | #3 | Drift visibility informs policy coverage |
| #15 (Off-peak scaling) | #14 | Scaling targets post runtime decision |

## Milestones & Metrics

| Milestone | Target Date | Metric | Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Vault Consolidation Plan | 2025-10-24 | # of active vaults | <= 2 |
| Drift Pipeline Live | 2025-10-24 | Nightly job success rate | >= 95% |
| Logic App Reduction | 2025-10-31 | Workflow count | <= 2 |
| RBAC Enforcement | 2025-10-31 | Non-compliant principals | 0 |
| Workspace Consolidation Decision | 2025-11-07 | Default workspaces retained | <= 1 |
| Runtime Strategy Decision | 2025-11-14 | Duplicate runtimes | <= 1 pattern |
| AI Audit Logging Live | 2025-11-14 | % logged AI outputs | >= 90% |
| Secret Rotation Automation | 2025-11-21 | Secrets rotated within SLA | >= 95% |
| Policy Guardrails Active | 2025-11-21 | Blocked non-compliant deploys | >= 1 captured |
| Off-peak Scaling Operational | 2025-12-05 | Energy/cost reduction | >= 15% idle cost decrease |

## Risk Register (Selected)

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Delay in vault consolidation | High | Medium | Time-box discovery; escalate decisions |
| Drift pipeline false positives | Medium | Medium | Baseline allowlist & iterative tuning |
| Logic App decommission regression | Medium | Low | Capture pre-removal flow logs & test harness |
| Runtime consolidation stalls | Medium | Medium | Decision record with explicit criteria |
| Bias checklist underutilized | High | Low | Integrate into PR template & release gating |

## Governance Alignment

- Security by Design: Sprints 1â€“2 vault/RBAC/rotation.
- Operational Excellence: Drift pipeline, policy guardrails.
- Cost Optimization: Plan/workspace/off-peak consolidation.
- AI Governance: Audit logging & bias checklist.
- Sustainability: Off-peak scaling & runtime efficiency.

## Implementation Playbook (High-Level)

1. Discovery & Inventory (Week 1): Confirm vaults, logic apps, function/web usage, telemetry assets.
2. Decision Records: Vault consolidation, runtime strategy, workspace consolidation.
3. CI Additions: Drift compare job; policy compliance test; secret rotation schedule monitor.
4. Observability Enhancements: Add AI output structured logging fields (promptHash, responseId, agentName).
5. Guardrails: Azure Policy definitions (tag enforcement, disallow public endpoints), integrated into pipeline.
6. Optimization: Introduce cache layer (Redis) post runtime decision; autoscale tuning based on early metrics.
7. Sustainability: Off-peak schedule (cron + scale rules) and monthly energy/cost report.

## Backlog (Future / Stretch)

- Conftest/OPA policy-as-code integration.
- SLO dashboard (latency, availability) for Orchestrator & RemoteData.
- Carbon-aware region selection heuristic.
- Confidential computing evaluation for sensitive payloads.

## Tracking Instructions

Add all issues (#1-#15, #16 epic) to a GitHub Project (Beta) named "Architecture Improvement Q4 2025" with custom fields:

- Pillar (picklist)
- Severity (High/Medium/Low)
- Effort (S/M/L)
- Sprint (1/2/3)

### Suggested GitHub Project Setup Steps

1. Create Project: Navigate to organization or user Projects -> New Project.
2. Add Fields: Pillar, Severity, Effort, Sprint, Status.
3. Bulk Add Issues: Use "Add items" -> paste issue URLs (#1-#16).
4. Create Views:
   - Board by Sprint
   - Table with filters: Severity = High
   - Chart: Count by Pillar
5. Automation: Add workflow to set Status="In Progress" when issue moves to Sprint column.

## Completion Definition

Epic considered complete when metrics thresholds for first 9 milestones met and all High severity issues closed.

Roadmap prepared 2025-10-16.
