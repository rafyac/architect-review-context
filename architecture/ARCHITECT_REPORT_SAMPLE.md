# Architecture Assessment Report (Sample)

> Timebox: 15 minute demo session  
> Date: 2025-10-15  
> Reviewer: Enterprise Cloud & AI Architect

## 1. Executive Summary

Context: Foundry Demo Agent Framework with multi-agent orchestration (RemoteData → Energy → Email pipeline) deployed via modular Bicep to Sweden Central.  
Key Strengths: Modular Bicep, clear agent separation, Application Insights present, Logic Apps abstraction for email, stateless function/API design.  
Top Risks: (1) No Key Vault referenced for secret centralization, (2) Single-region deployment without DR strategy, (3) Lack of resource tagging for FinOps governance.  
Immediate Priority Actions: Implement Key Vault & secret rotation; define region failover plan; apply mandatory resource tags.

## 2. System Context & Scope

Business goal: Persisted AI agents performing data retrieval, analysis, reporting & emailing.  
Repository Components: Agents (`Energy`, `RemoteData`, `EmailGenerator`, `EmailAssistant`, `Orchestrator`), ExternalSignals API, infra Bicep modules.  
Azure Resources (summary):

| Type | Count | Region | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Cognitive Services (2 + project) | 3 | swedencentral | AI project + general cognitive accounts |
| Event Grid System Topics | 4 | swedencentral | Possibly duplicates—verify active subscriptions |
| Application Insights | 1 | swedencentral | Central telemetry |
| Action Group / Smart Detector | 2 | global | Alerting baseline present |
| (No Key Vault detected) | 0 | - | Gap for secrets management |

## 3. Pillar Findings

### 3.1 Security & Identity
Strengths: Managed identity pattern anticipated; no hard-coded secrets observed in instructions.  
Gaps: Absence of Key Vault module usage in active environment; unclear secret rotation policy.  
Risks: High – potential secret sprawl and audit deficiency.

### 3.2 Reliability & Resilience
Strengths: Stateless agents and Functions enable rapid recovery.  
Gaps: Single region only; no documented RPO/RTO; limited alert coverage (only smart detector).  
Risks: Medium – regional outage impact; delayed detection of non-failure degradations.

### 3.3 Performance Efficiency
Strengths: Event-driven pattern potential via Event Grid; compute likely consumption-based.  
Gaps: No sizing strategy or concurrency limits documented; lack of caching for repeated data retrieval.  
Risks: Low – cost/performance inefficiency under scale.

### 3.4 Cost Optimization
Strengths: Consumption services (Functions, potential scale-to-zero).  
Gaps: Missing tags; duplicate system topics inflate overhead; no cost review cadence.  
Risks: Medium – uncontrolled spend & poor allocation visibility.

### 3.5 Operational Excellence
Strengths: Modular Bicep (`infra/modules`); environment variants (`main-dev`, `main-complete`).  
Gaps: No documented CI pipeline for what-if validation; runbooks absent; limited telemetry segmentation.  
Risks: Medium – slower incident triage & change assurance.

### 3.6 Sustainability
Strengths: Serverless / scale-to-zero reduces idle footprint.  
Gaps: No consolidation review of low-utilization Event Grid topics; no energy metrics tracking.  
Risks: Low – incremental inefficiencies.

### 3.7 AI Governance & Data Ethics
Strengths: Distinct instruction files per agent; deterministic energy calculation path.  
Gaps: Lack of prompt version metadata; no output safety or PII logging policy; absence of review sign-off process.  
Risks: Medium – audit & reproducibility challenges.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Risk Matrix

| Risk | Pillar | Impact | Likelihood | Severity | Effort | Reference |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Missing Key Vault | Security | High | High | High | M | infra/modules/keyvault.bicep (planned) |
| Single-region only | Reliability | High | Medium | High | M | main-dev.bicep |
| No tagging strategy | Cost | Medium | High | Medium | S | All resources |
| Duplicate Event Grid topics | Cost/Operational | Medium | Medium | Medium | S | Event Grid system topics |
| No prompt versioning | AI Governance | Medium | High | Medium | S | Agents/*Instructions.md |

## 5. Recommendations

| Pillar | Action | Rationale | Effort (S/M/L) | Owner Role | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Security | Implement Key Vault & migrate secrets | Centralize & enable rotation | M | Platform Eng | keyvault module (add) |
| Reliability | Define DR strategy (secondary region template) | Reduce outage blast radius | M | Platform Eng | main.bicep (extend) |
| Cost | Apply mandatory tags (env, owner, costCenter, app) | Enable FinOps tracking | S | Platform Eng | All resources |
| AI Governance | Introduce prompt version front-matter | Improve traceability & audit | S | App Team | Agents/*Instructions.md |
| Operational Excellence | Add CI what-if & lint pipeline for Bicep | Prevent drift & validate changes | M | DevOps | infra/ *.bicep |

| Title | Labels | Description | Acceptance Criteria | References |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| [Security] Implement Key Vault | pillar-security, severity-high, effort-M | Add Vault + migrate secrets from env vars. | Vault deployed; secrets stored; rotation policy doc. | Planned keyvault module |
| [Reliability] Define DR strategy | pillar-reliability, severity-high, effort-M | Add secondary region deployment plan. | DR doc with RPO/RTO; test failover procedure placeholder. | main.bicep |
| [Cost] Apply resource tagging | pillar-cost, severity-medium, effort-S | Tag all resources with env, owner, app, costCenter. | 100% tag coverage; ARG query proof. | All resource IDs |
| [AI Governance] Version prompts | pillar-ai-governance, severity-medium, effort-S | Add front-matter metadata to instruction files. | Version + lastReviewed fields present. | Agents/*Instructions.md |

## 7. Assumptions & Data Gaps

- No Key Vault currently deployed (assumed from inventory).  
- Tag coverage not validated—ARG tag queries returned empty.  
- Event Grid subscription utilization unknown.  
- No explicit RPO/RTO documented in repo.  
- AI output safety controls presumed minimal.

## 8. Alignment to Architecture Constitution

| Recommendation | Principle Ref |
|----------------|---------------|
| Implement Key Vault | 1. Security by Design |
| Define DR strategy | 2. Reliability & Resilience |
| Apply resource tagging | 4. Cost Optimization |
| Version prompts | 7. Data & AI Governance |
| Add Bicep CI pipeline | 5. Operational Excellence |

## 9. Follow-Up Plan

Schedule next review: 2025-11-15  
Metrics: tag coverage %, number of rotated secrets, prompt version adoption %, alert rule count.  
Ownership: Platform Eng (infra), App Team (agents), Security (vault policy), FinOps (tag audit).
